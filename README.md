About me

My name is Jarid Tillman, and I am a transitioning servicemember. I am looking for opportunities in the cybersecurity domain. But before I tell you more about what I do, let me tell you why I do it. I develop teams and processes so that everyone can be their best. I make people feel apart of the team and things smooth/ more efficient. I am currently in my last year of my Bachelor of Science in Finance with a minor in Economics. I would like a cybersecurity role as information security analyst or a cybersecurity analyst at a financial institution.
